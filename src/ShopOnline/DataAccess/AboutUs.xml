	<AboutUs>
		We are media-service provider sharing access to the best movies. But we still have in mind 
		that you might prefer using storage mediums - not only those contemporary but a little "ancient" as well.
		We would love to share with you our Collection and make you just happy! We are keen to help 
		you relax not only after signing up to our database and choosing what you wish but also with 
		the sound of briskly spinning DVD. Moreover, something for real connoisseurs: the whisper 
		and smell of working magnetic tape cassettes are possible to be heard and felt again! 
		The purest old-school!
		Come in, enjoy and spend beautiful moments with us!
